    <h2> Innocent Death</h2>
    <p> one out of ten dogs borns will find a permanent home.Every year <u><b>7.6 million</b></u>dogs and cats are admitted to an animal shelter. However; 2.7 millio dogs and cats are then killed because there isn't enough space for all of these neglected animals. Homeless animals out number homeless people five to one. Although, many strays are lost pets that were not properly kept indoors or provided with an identification. To prevent strays, overpopulation, and eventually death for animals all it takes is for us to keep a close eye out for ay animal that may be lost. </p>
